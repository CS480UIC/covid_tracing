# Database Description
The overall idea of this project is to keep record of each employee and student to improve the contact tracing method.
In this database, we will store the basic information of an employee and a student. Such as, the university they are attending, 
what department they are in along with their name and ID number. Then each employee and student will also have a section for
their vaccination status and their schedule. Since many schools already have their own application, this database will be added
to their current software. And lastly, our project is different from others because it contains both individualsâ€™ vaccine status and their schedules at once.
